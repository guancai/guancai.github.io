<p>Standard reference spectra are defined to allow the performance comparison of photovoltaic devices from different manufacturers and research laboratories. The first standardised solar spectrum came from the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) in 1972 and represented the solar noon sun at the equator on an equinox ($θ_s = 0°$) with no cloud but a defined volume of water vapour, ozone and aerosols in the atmosphere. They also suggested using an irradiance of 1000 W/m$^2$ (100 mW/cm$^2$) in the 290 nm – 3000 nm wavelength range as a reference intensity. This reference spectrum has been refined over the years. In 1982 the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) published two calculated reference spectra that would become the basis for standardised solar cell testing:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A direct normal irradiance spectrum (AM1.5D)</li>
  <li>A global horizontal irradiance spectrum (AM1.5G)</li>
</ol>

<p>The ‘AM1.5’ in both reference spectrums refers to the <strong>air mass</strong> used in calculating the spectra. As the sunlight travels through the atmosphere, chemicals interact with the sunlight and absorb certain wavelengths changing the amount of short-wavelength light reaching the Earth’s surface. Both absorption and scattering depend rather strongly on the path length of sunlight through the atmosphere, i.e. on the sun’s elevation angle above the horizon. <u>Air mass is the path length which light takes through the atmosphere normalized to the shortest possible path length (that is, when the sun is directly overhead). The Air Mass quantifies the reduction in the power of light as it passes through the atmosphere and is absorbed by air and dust.</u>  The air mass is defined as:</p>

\[\mathrm{AM} = \frac{1}{\cos(\theta)}\]

<p>where $\theta$ is the angle (in degrees) from the vertical (zenith angle) (see Figure 2).</p>

<center>
  <img src="/images/wiki/AM15-2.png" />
  <br />
  <b>Figure 2</b>. Schematic of air mass definition
</center>

<p>The above calculation for air mass assumes that the atmosphere is a flat horizontal layer, but because of the curvature of the atmosphere, the air mass is not quite equal to the atmospheric path length when the sun is close to the horizon. However, it is reasonably accurate for values of zenith angel up to around 75°. At sunrise, the angle of the sun from the vertical position is 90° and the air mass is infinite, whereas the path length clearly is not. An equation which incorporates the curvature of the earth is:</p>

\[\mathrm{AM} = \frac{1}{\cos(\theta)+0.50572(96.07995-\theta)^{-1.6364}}\]

<p><strong>AM0</strong>, meaning “zero atmospheres”, is the spectrum outside the atmosphere. Solar cells used for space power applications, like those on communications satellites, are generally characterized using AM0.</p>

<p><strong>AM1.5</strong>, <u>corresponding to a solar zenith angle of 48.2°, was chosen as the ‘standard’ for terrestrial solar cell testing because it is a good representation of the yearly average irradiance in the temperate latitudes where there are many large population centres.</u>  <strong>The latest AM1.5 standards pertaining to photovoltaic applications are the <a href="/files/data/AM0AM1_5.xls">ASTM G-173</a> and IEC 60904.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>AM1.5D: The direct radiation of the test plane when sunlight passes through 1.5 times thickness of the atmosphere at an angle of θ=48.2°. It is defined for solar concentrator work. It includes the the direct beam from the sun plus the circumsolar component in a disk 2.5 degrees around the sun. The direct plus circumsolar spectrum has an integrated power density of 900 W/m$^2$.</li>
  <li>AM1.5G: The global radiation of the test plane when sunlight passes through 1.5 times thickness of the atmosphere at an angle of θ=48.2°. The sum of the direct and diffuse radiation. It is designed for flat plate modules and has an integrated power of 1000 W/m$^2$ (100 mW/cm$^2$).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The difference between AM 1.5G and AM1.5D</strong>: Solar radiation refers to the electromagnetic waves and particle streams emitted by the sun into space. The solar radiation energy received by earth is only one-twentieth billionth of the total solar radiation. Common solar radiation nouns are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Direct: When sunlight passes through the atmosphere, part of it reaches the ground without changing its radiation direction.</li>
  <li>Diffuse: Another portion of solar radiation that changes direction after being reflected and scattered by the atmosphere.</li>
  <li>Global: The sum of the direct and diffuse solar radiation reaching the ground after the weakening of the atmosphere.</li>
  <li>The relationship between Direct/Diffuse/Global is as the formula：</li>
</ul>

\[\mathrm{Global} = \mathrm{Direct} * \cos(\theta) + \mathrm{Diffuse}\]

The open circuit potential is obtained by monitoring the rate of change of the WE potential until it is negligible.</p>

<p>For a PEC water splitting device, the redox couples of interest are the H$^+$/$\mathrm{H_2}$ couple for a p-type semiconductor photocathode, and the $\mathrm{O_2}$/$\mathrm{H_2}$O couple for an n-type semiconductor photoanode. In the case of an n-type semiconductor, the established thermodynamic equilibrium ($E_F = E_\mathrm{O_2/H_2O}$) between the semiconductor and the electrolyte results in an upward band bending of the semiconductor surface. In the dark, the measured $V_\mathrm{oc-dark}$ is thus the $E_F / E_\mathrm{O_2/H_2O}$ relative to the RE. Whereas in the light, the $E_\mathrm{F_n}$ rises because of the higher occupancy of the conduction band and the $E_\mathrm{F_p}$ equilibrates with the $E_\mathrm{redox}$ ($E_\mathrm{F_p} = E_\mathrm{O_2/H_2O}$). The measured $V_\mathrm{oc-light}$ is thus the $E_\mathrm{F_n}$ relative to the RE. Furthermore, under illumination, the photogenerated holes can accumulate at the surface lowering the barrier for electrons with increasing light intensity until the electrons can reach the surface at the same rate as holes, at which condition the measured $V_\mathrm{oc-light}$ approximates the $V_\mathrm{fb}$ versus the RE.</p>

<p><strong>The photovoltage $V_\mathrm{ph}$</strong> generated by the semiconductor is given by the difference between the hole and electron quasi-Fermi levels under illumination, that is, by the free energy difference between the majority carriers and the photoexcited minority carriers. Illuminating the electrode surface will shift the Fermi level of the bulk (measured $V_\mathrm{oc}$) towards more anodic potentials for a p-type material and towards more cathodic potentials for a n-type material. Accordingly,</p>

\[V_\mathrm{ph} = |E_\mathrm{f_n}-E_\mathrm{f_p}|=|V_\mathrm{oc-light}-V_\mathrm{oc-dark}|\]

<p>Note, however, that the $V_\mathrm{ph}$ measured at open circuit may not exactly reﬂect the $V_\mathrm{ph}$ under operating conditions since the latter must also include the kinetic overpotential for the reaction of interest.</p>

<p>In solid-state physics, the <strong>work function</strong> (sometimes spelt <strong>workfunction</strong>, WF) is the minimum thermodynamic work (i.e., energy) needed to remove an electron from a solid to a point in the vacuum immediately outside the solid surface. Here “immediately” means that the final electron position is far from the surface on the atomic scale (the force between the electron and its image charge in the surface can be neglected, many nm), but still too close to the solid to be influenced by ambient electric fields in the vacuum. <u>The work function is not a characteristic of a bulk material, but rather a property of the surface of the material (depending on crystal face and contamination).</u></p>

<p>The work function $W$ for a given surface is defined by the difference</p>

\[W = -e\phi - E_F\]

<p>where $−e$ is the charge of an electron, $\phi$ is the electrostatic potential in the vacuum nearby the surface, and $E_F$ is the Fermi level (electrochemical potential of electrons) inside the material. The term $−e\phi$ is the energy of an electron at rest in the vacuum nearby the surface. Because the Fermi level is the chemical potential of the system, by definition, <u>the work function is equal to the energy difference between the Fermi level and the vacuum level at the surface of the material</u>.</p>

<p>In practice, one directly controls $E_F$ by the voltage applied to the material through electrodes, and the work function is generally a fixed characteristic of the surface material. Consequently, this means that when a voltage is applied to a material, the electrostatic potential $\phi$ produced in the vacuum will be somewhat lower than the applied voltage, the difference depending on the work function of the material surface. Rearranging the above equation, one has</p>

\[\phi = V- \frac{W}{e}\]

<p>where $V = −E_F/e$ is the voltage of the material (as measured by a voltmeter, through an attached electrode), relative to an electrical ground that is defined as having zero Fermi level. The fact that $\phi$ depends on the material surface means that the space between two dissimilar conductors will have a built-in electric field, when those conductors are in total equilibrium with each other (electrically shorted to each other, and with equal temperatures).</p>

<p>Here, one should note that the minimum energy required to extract one electron from either a semiconductor or insulator is not the WF but the ionization energy (IE). The electron affinity (EA), which is the energy released by adding one electron to a material, is a concept similar to the WF but the direction of electron transfer is opposite. For metals, the EA has the same value as the WF (See <strong>Figure 1</strong>).</p>

<h3 id="wf-of-elements">WF of Elements</h3>

<p>Because WF is dependent on the cleanliness of the surface, measurements reported in the literature often cover a considerable range. <strong>Figure 2</strong> contains selected values for the electron work function of the elements which may be regarded as typical values for a reasonably clean surface. Those values, marked R in the table, come from analysis of results from different measurement methods. The method of measurement is indicated for each value. The following abbreviations appear:</p>

<p>The WFs of metal oxides can be difficult to reproduce because there are so many factors that alter an oxide’s work function (WF values for a given material can span over 1 eV). <u>The large variation in reported WF values is because WF represents the sum of electron chemical potential and surface dipole, and it is very sensitive to a number of factors.</u> Fators such as surface roughness, exposed crystal face, radiation exposure,  and adsorbate coverage affect the surface dipole component, whereas electron chemical potential is affected by the chemical identity of a material, the presence of impurities and the stoichiometry of a material.</p>

<p>Although there are many factors that can alter WF, it is possible to gain control over many of these factors to tune WF. Under certain preparation conditions, one can obtain reproducible WF values for a given material. A compilation of WF values for various metal oxides (prepared by <em>in-situ</em> metal oxidation) is provided in <strong>Table 1</strong>. The values in Table 1 represent the average of the most thermodynamically stable crystal faces of each oxide, as the oxides represented here were polycrystalline and prepared by <em>in-situ</em> metal oxidation. The oxides were not exposed to air, so adsorbates likely have a minimal effect on the WF values shown here. Furthermore, as the oxides were prepared via <em>in-situ</em> oxidation (and vacuum annealing in the case of reduced oxides), they should all consist of stable oxygen-terminated surfaces. Consequently, the magnitude of the surface dipole in the WF values listed in Table 1 can be considered similar in magnitude. Thus, the values allow an approximate comparison of relative electron chemical potential values.</p>

For PEC systems, the <strong>solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency</strong> is the single value by which all PEC devices can be reliably ranked against one another, which can be directly determined by analysis of the hydrogen formed under solar AM 1.5G illumination <u>in the absence of an applied bias</u>. For a correct STH efficiency measurement, the working electrode (WE) and counter electrode (CE) should be short-circuited, which infers that STH is <u>measured in a 2-electrode system</u>. Besides, one must have both the WE and CE immersed in the same pH solution. In addition, <u>the electrolyte should not contain any sacrificial donors or acceptors</u>.</p>

<p><strong>STH</strong> can be calculated from the product of the rate of hydrogen production $r_\mathrm{H_2}$ (mmol/s) and the gain in Gibbs energy $\Delta G$ (237 kJ mol$^{−1}$).</p>

\[\eta_{\mathrm{STH}}=\left[\frac{r_{\mathrm{H}_2} \times \Delta G}{P_{\text {total }} \times S}\right]_{\mathrm{AM} 1.5 \mathrm{G}}\]

<p>where $P_\textrm{total}$ is the energy flux of the sunlight (mW/cm$^2$) and <em>S</em> is the illuminated photoelectrode area (cm$^2$). Or, it can be calculated from the product of voltage, current, and the <strong>faradaic efficiency</strong> for hydrogen evolution $\eta_F$.</p>

\[\eta_{\mathrm{STH}}=\left[\frac{\left|J_{\mathrm{SC}}\right| \times 1.23(\mathrm{~V}) \times \eta_{\mathrm{F}}}{P_{\text {total }}}\right]_{\mathrm{AM} 1.5 \mathrm{G}}\]

<p>where$ J_\mathrm{SC}$ is the short-circuit photocurrent density (mA/cm$^2$) normalized to the illuminated electrode area.</p>

<p>For PEC systems that require an external bias to split water, $\eta_\textrm{STH}$ is zero. However, other metrics are invaluable scientifically and can be employed to provide insight into the functionality and limitations of a PEC device. <u>These metrics including applied-bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE), half-cell solar-to-hydrogen efficiency (HC-STH), external quantum efficiency (EQE) = incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE), and internal quantum efficiency (IQE) = absorbed photon-to-current efficiency (APCE) are called diagnostic efficiencies.</u></p>

<p><strong>ABPE</strong> measures the net chemical output power (rate of production of free energy of products less the input electrical power) of a system in units of incident solar power, and it represents the fraction of the energy stored in the chemical products that can be assigned to the photovoltage provided by the input solar illumination. It is frequently used for two-electrode measurements when an external voltage is applied to PEC systems as the electrical energy has to be subtracted from the energy gain. As with STH, ABPE measurements also require that both the WE and CE should be immersed in the same pH solution and the electrolyte should not contain any sacrificial donors or acceptors. ABPE is the difference of the power output in chemical fuel and any added electrical input power, divided by the solar power input.</p>

\[\eta_{\mathrm{ABPE}}=\left[\frac{\left|J_{\mathrm{ph}}\right| \times\left(1.23-V_{\mathrm{b}}\right) \times \eta_{\mathrm{F}}}{P_{\text {total }}}\right]_{\mathrm{AM} 1.5 \mathrm{G}}\]

<p>where $J_\textrm{ph}$ (mA/cm$^2$) is the photocurrent density obtained under an applied bias V$_\textrm{b}$ (V).</p>

<p>For a photoanode (photocathode) measured in the three-electrode configuration, the product of the potential gain and the photocurrent could be regarded as the hypothetical <strong>HC-STH</strong>. The gain in potential by PEC water splitting could be approximated by the difference of the potential of a photoanode (photocathode) from the oxygen (hydrogen) equilibrium potential:</p>

\[\eta_{\mathrm{HC}-\mathrm{STH}}=\left\{\begin{array}{l}
{\left[\frac{\left|J_{\mathrm{ph}}\right| \times\left(E_{\mathrm{O}_2 / \mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{O}}-E_{\mathrm{b}}\right)}{P_{\text {total }}}\right]_{\mathrm{AM} 1.5 \mathrm{G}}} \\
{\left[\frac{\left[J_{\mathrm{ph}} \mid \times\left(E_{\mathrm{b}}-E_{\mathrm{H}^{+} / \mathrm{H} 2}\right)\right.}{P_{\text {total }}}\right]_{\mathrm{AM} 1.5 \mathrm{G}}}
\end{array}\right.\]

<p>where $E_\textrm{b}$ is the applied potential (<em>vs.</em> RHE). $E_\mathrm{O_2/H_2O}$ and $E_\mathrm{H^+/H_2}$ stand for the equilibrium potentials of oxygen evolution (+1.23 V <em>vs.</em> RHE) and hydrogen evolution (0 V <em>vs.</em> RHE), respectively. Provided that $η_F$ of PEC water splitting is unity and that a counter electrode drives the counter reaction without any overpotential, HC-STH is a convenient estimate of maximum ABPE of a half-cell independent of properties of a counter electrode. In reality, however, the potential of a counter electrode is not equilibrated with the potential of the redox reaction on the counter electrode as mentioned in the previous section. Therefore, HC-STH should not be regarded as ABPE.</p>

<p><strong>IPCE</strong> describes the photocurrent collected per incident photon flux as a function of illumination wavelength. The researcher can ideally integrate the IPCE data over the solar spectrum to estimate the maximum possible STH efficiency for that device, but only for the IPCE data collected under zero bias (2-electrode, short-circuit) conditions. IPCE under an applied bias is not considered a valid estimate for STH, but it is still a useful diagnostic tool that gives insight into the PEC material properties because it yields device efficiency in terms of “electrons out per photons in”. IPCE takes into account efficiencies for three fundamental processes involved in PEC: photon absorptance, defined as the fraction of electron-hole pairs generated per incident photon flux ($\eta_{e­^-/h^+}$), charge transport to the solid-liquid interface ($\eta_\textrm{charge separation}$), and the efficiency of interfacial charge transfer ($\eta_\textrm{charge injection}$). This method assumes that the counter electrode is not limiting current flowing through the circuit.</p>

\[\text { IPCE }=\eta_{\mathrm{e}^{-}/\mathrm{h^+}} \times \eta_{\text {charge separation }} \times \eta_{\text {charge injection }}\]

<p>where</p>

\[\eta_{\mathrm{e}^{-} / \mathrm{h}^{+}}=\frac{I_0-I}{I}=1-10^{-A_e}\]

<p>where $A$ is the absorbance of a sample defined as the logarithmic ratio of the measured output light intensity ($I$) versus the initial input light intensity ($I_0$).</p>

<p>IPCE is usually obtained from a chronoamperometry (potentiostatic) measurement. In this system, a bias can be applied between the sample/working electrode versus a counter electrode (2-electrode experiment) or a reference electrode (3-electrode experiment) while measuring the current that arises from subjecting the PEC electrode to monochromatic light at various wavelengths. The difference between the steady-state current under monochromatic illumination and the steady-state background current is the photocurrent that arises due to redox reactions occurring at the surface of the working and counter electrodes.</p>

\[\eta_{\mathrm{IPCE}}=\frac{\text { electrons }}{\text { photons }}=\frac{\left|J_{\mathrm{ph}}\right| \times h c}{P_{\text {mono }} \times \lambda}\]

<p>where $P_\textrm{mono}$ is the calibrated and monochromated illumination power intensity (mW/cm$^2$), and $\lambda$ (nm) is the wavelength at which this illumination power is measured. Besides, the integration of IPCE over the entire solar spectrum can provide an estimation of the maximum possible STH, if (and only if) no applied bias is used in the IPCE measurement.</p>

<p><strong>APCE</strong> describes the photocurrent collected per incident photon absorbed. This value is a particularly useful quantity to measure when studying thin films, because it helps to determine the optimum balance between maximal path length for photon absorption versus minimal effective carrier transport distance within the material.</p>

\[\text { APCE }=\frac{\text { IPCE }}{\eta_{\mathrm{e}^{-} / \mathrm{h}^{+}}}=\eta_{\text {charge separation }} \times \eta_{\text {charge injection }}\]

<p>By combining the equations for determining IPCE and $\eta_{e­^-/h^+}$ experimentally, we can derive APCE as follows:</p>

\[\eta_{\mathrm{APCE}}=\frac{\left|J_{\mathrm{ph}}\right| \times h c}{P_{\text {mono }} \times \lambda \times\left(1-10^{-A}\right)}\]

potential, the reverse-bias dependence of the inverse square capacitance of the space-charge region in the semiconductor is given by the Mott-Schottky relation: <!--more--></p>

\[\frac{1}{C^2}=\frac{2}{A^2\epsilon\epsilon_0 q N_D}(E-E_\textrm{fb}-\frac{kT}{q})\]

<p>where $C$ is the relative permittivity of Si (11.7), $q$ is the elementary charge, $N_D$ is the free charge carrier density in the semiconductor, $E$ is the potential difference between the semiconductor and the redox potential of the solution, $E_\textrm{fb}$ is the flat band potential, $k$ is the Boltzmann’s constant and $T$ is temperature (298 K).</p>

<p> Mott-Schottky is an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique that can be difﬁcult to perform and interpret if the system is not ideal. When the measurement is successful, it is able to determine both the $E_\textrm{fb}$ and the free charge carrier density (donors or acceptors, $N_D$) of the photoelectrode. The Mott-Schottky plot will possess a negative slope for p-type materials and a positive slope for n-type materials.</p>

<p>The primary disadvantage of M–S analysis is that the C sc of a photoelectrode can
be very complicated to measure depending on the sample composition and mor-
phology. The ideal sample is a single-crystal material of high crystalline quality
with moderate doping grown on an ohmic contact. Single-frequency measurements
of the C sc of an ideal sample are fairly straightforward. However, measurements
for samples which are not ideal may require a full evaluation of the frequency
range over many decades, followed by ﬁtting of the data to an appropriate, but
often complicated equivalent circuit model</p>

<p>The $E_\textrm{fb}$ can be determined by taking the value of the intercept between the extrapolated linear region of the $C^{−2}$ with the $x$-axis in the Mott-Schottky plot.</p>

<p> The barrier height ($\phi_b$) was calculated using the Schottky’s relation:

<p>Where $V_n$ is the difference between the potential of the conduction band edge and the Fermi level, and was obtained by using the following relationship:</p>

\[V_n=kT\,\textrm{ln}(\frac{N_C}{N_D})\]

<p>The density of conduction band states ($N_C$) was calculated by</p>

\[N_C=2(\frac{2\pi m^*_ekT}{h^2})^{3/2}\]

<p>where $m^*_e$ is the effective mass of electron and  $h$ is the Planck’s constant.</p>

<p> The theoretical maximum photocurrent density under light illumination, $J_\textrm{max} (A\,m^{-2})$, is calculated by integrating the photon flux, shown in equation:</p>

<!--more--></p>

\[J ^\mathrm{H_2O} _\textrm{photocurrent} = J _\textrm{absorbed} \times \eta _\textrm{charge separation} \times \eta _\textrm{charge injection}\]

<p>Where $\eta_\textrm{charge separation}$ is the yield of the photogenerated electrons/holes that reach the electrode/electrolyte interface or, in other words, the fraction of photogenerated electrons/holes that does not recombine with holes/electrons in the bulk of photoelectrodes. $\eta _\textrm{charge injection}$ is the yield of those electrons/holes that have reached the electrode/electrolyte interface and that are injected into the electrolyte to reduce/oxidize the water, or in other words, do not recombine with holes/electrons at surface traps. $J _\textrm{absorbed}$ is the current density converted from the absorbed photons when assuming that the absorbed photons are completely converted into electrons (APCE=100%), and it can be calculated by using the equation:</p>

\[J_\textrm{absorbed} = e\times\int\limits_{\lambda_a}^{\lambda_b}\frac{P(\lambda)}{\frac{hc}{\lambda}}A(\lambda)d\lambda = \frac{e}{hc}\times \int\limits_{\lambda_a}^{\lambda_b} P(\lambda)A(\lambda) \lambda d\lambda\]

<p>where $ \lambda_a$ is the shortest wavelength of the light emitted by the light source, $ \lambda_b$ is the wavelength of the absorption edge of the photoelectrode. $P$,$\lambda$, $h$, $c$, $e$, and $A$ are the power of incident photons, the wavelength of the incident monochromatic light, the Planck constant, the light speed, the charge of single electron, and the absorbance of the photoelectrode, respectively.</p>

<p> On the other hand, $\eta_\textrm{charge separation}$ is assumed to become 100% ($\eta_\textrm{charge injection} = 1$) in the presence of electron scavenger (usually ascorbic acid) or hole scavenger (usually H$_2$O$_2$ or Na$_2$SO$ _3$) in the electrolyte, then the photocurrent measured with scavenger in the electrolyte ($J^\textrm{scavenger} _\textrm{photocurrent}$) is a product of $J _\textrm{absorbed}$ and $\eta _\textrm{charge separation}$ only:</p>

\[J^\textrm{scavenger} _\textrm{photocurrent}=J _\textrm{absorbed}\times\eta _\textrm{charge separation}\]

<p>So, the $\eta_\textrm{charge separation}$ and $\eta_\textrm{charge injection}$ can be calculated by</p>

\[\eta _\textrm{charge separation}= J^\textrm{scavenger} _\textrm{photocurrent} /J _\textrm{absorbed}\]

\[\eta _\textrm{charge injection}=J^\mathrm{H_2O} _\textrm{photocurrent}/J^\textrm{scavenger} _\textrm{photocurrent}\]

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>The scavenger used should be transparent to visible and UV light, does not corrode the photoelectrode, and importantly the injection barrier is removed and the surface recombination is suppressed. (No transient photocurrent in the chopped light J-t measurement)</li>
  <li>The band bending should remain the same in both electrolyte solution (with and without the scavenger), namely, the flat band potential should be the same from Mott-Schottky measurement.</li>
