For PEC systems, the <strong>solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency</strong> is the single value by which all PEC devices can be reliably ranked against one another, which can be directly determined by analysis of the hydrogen formed under solar AM 1.5G illumination <u>in the absence of an applied bias</u>. For a correct STH efficiency measurement, the working electrode (WE) and counter electrode (CE) should be short-circuited, which infers that STH is <u>measured in a 2-electrode system</u>. Besides, one must have both the WE and CE immersed in the same pH solution. In addition, <u>the electrolyte should not contain any sacrificial donors or acceptors</u>. <!--more--></p>

<p>STH can be calculated from the product of the rate of hydrogen production $r_\textrm{H$_2$}$ (mmol/s) and the gain in Gibbs energy $\Delta G$ (237 kJ mol$^{−1}$).</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>where $P_\textrm{total}$ is the energy flux of the sunlight (mW/cm$^2$) and <em>S</em> is the illuminated photoelectrode area (cm$^2$). Or, it can be calculated from the product of voltage, current, and the <strong>faradaic efficiency</strong> for hydrogen evolution $\eta _F$.</p>

<p>where$ J_\textrm{SC}$ is the short-circuit photocurrent density (mA/cm$^2$) normalized to the illuminated electrode area.</p>

<p> For PEC systems that require an external bias to split water, $\eta_\textrm{STH}$ is zero. However, other metrics are invaluable scientifically and can be employed to provide insight into the functionality and limitations of a PEC device. These metrics including applied-bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE), half-cell solar-to-hydrogen efficiency (HC-STH), external quantum efficiency (EQE) = incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE), and internal quantum efficiency (IQE) = absorbed photon-to-current efficiency (APCE) are called diagnostic efficiencies.</p>

<p> <strong>ABPE</strong> measures the net chemical output power (rate of production of free energy of products less the input electrical power) of a system in units of incident solar power, and it represents the fraction of the energy stored in the chemical products that can be assigned to the photovoltage provided by the input solar illumination. It is frequently used for two-electrode measurements when an external voltage is applied to PEC systems as the electrical energy has to be subtracted from the energy gain. As with STH, ABPE measurements also require that both the WE and CE should be immersed in the same pH solution and the electrolyte should not contain any sacrificial donors or acceptors. ABPE is the difference of the power output in chemical fuel and any added electrical input power, divided by the solar power input.</p>

<p>where Jph (mA/cm$^2$) is the photocurrent density obtained under an applied bias Vb (V).</p>

<p> For a photoanode (photocathode) measured in the three-electrode configuration, the product of the potential gain and the photocurrent could be regarded as the hypothetical <strong>HC-STH</strong>. The gain in potential by PEC water splitting could be approximated by the difference of the potential of a photoanode (photocathode) from the oxygen (hydrogen) equilibrium potential:</p>

<p>where Eb is the applied potential (<em>vs.</em> RHE). <em>E</em>O2/H2O and <em>E</em>H+/H2 stand for the equilibrium potentials of oxygen evolution (+1.23 V <em>vs.</em> RHE) and hydrogen evolution (0 V <em>vs.</em> RHE), respectively. Provided that <em>η</em>F of PEC water splitting is unity and that a counter electrode drives the counter reaction without any overpotential, HC-STH is a convenient estimate of maximum ABPE of a half-cell independent of properties of a counter electrode. In reality, however, the potential of a counter electrode is not equilibrated with the potential of the redox reaction on the counter electrode as mentioned in the previous section. Therefore, HC-STH should not be regarded as ABPE.</p>

<p> <strong>IPCE</strong> describes the photocurrent collected per incident photon flux as a function of illumination wavelength. The researcher can ideally integrate the IPCE data over the solar spectrum to estimate the maximum possible STH efficiency for that device, but only for the IPCE data collected under zero bias (2-electrode, short-circuit) conditions. IPCE under an applied bias is not considered a valid estimate for STH, but it is still a useful diagnostic tool that gives insight into the PEC material properties because it yields device efficiency in terms of “electrons out per photons in”. IPCE takes into account efficiencies for three fundamental processes involved in PEC: photon absorptance, defined as the fraction of electron-hole pairs generated per incident photon flux (ηe­-/h+), charge transport to the solid-liquid interface (ηcharge separation), and the efficiency of interfacial charge transfer (ηcharge injection). This method assumes that the counter electrode is not limiting current flowing through the circuit.</p>

<p>where</p>

<p>where A is the absorbance of a sample defined as the logarithmic ratio of the measured output light intensity (I) versus the initial input light intensity (I0).</p>

<p>IPCE is usually obtained from a chronoamperometry (potentiostatic) measurement. In this system, a bias can be applied between the sample/working electrode versus a counter electrode (2-electrode experiment) or a reference electrode (3-electrode experiment) while measuring the current that arises from subjecting the PEC electrode to monochromatic light at various wavelengths. The difference between the steady-state current under monochromatic illumination and the steady-state background current is the photocurrent that arises due to redox reactions occurring at the surface of the working and counter electrodes.</p>

<p>where Pmono is the calibrated and monochromated illumination power intensity (mW/cm$^2$), and λ (nm) is the wavelength at which this illumination power is measured. Besides, the integration of IPCE over the entire solar spectrum can provide an estimation of the maximum possible STH, if (and only if) no applied bias is used in the IPCE measurement.</p>

<p>  <strong>APCE</strong> describes the photocurrent collected per incident photon absorbed. This value is a particularly useful quantity to measure when studying thin films, because it helps to determine the optimum balance between maximal path length for photon absorption versus minimal effective carrier transport distance within the material.</p>

<p>By combining the equations for determining IPCE and ηe­-/h+ experimentally, we can derive APCE as follows:</p>

potential, the reverse-bias dependence of the inverse square capacitance of the space-charge region in the semiconductor is given by the Mott-Schottky relation: <!--more--></p>

\[\frac{1}{C^2}=\frac{2}{A^2\epsilon\epsilon_0 q N_D}(E-E_\textrm{fb}-\frac{kT}{q})\]

<p>where $C$ is the relative permittivity of Si (11.7), $q$ is the elementary charge, $N_D$ is the free charge carrier density in the semiconductor, $E$ is the potential difference between the semiconductor and the redox potential of the solution, $E_\textrm{fb}$ is the flat band potential, $k$ is the Boltzmann’s constant and $T$ is temperature (298 K).</p>

<p> Mott-Schottky is an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique that can be difﬁcult to perform and interpret if the system is not ideal. When the measurement is successful, it is able to determine both the $E_\textrm{fb}$ and the free charge carrier density (donors or acceptors, $N_D$) of the photoelectrode. The Mott-Schottky plot will possess a negative slope for p-type materials and a positive slope for n-type materials.</p>

<p>The primary disadvantage of M–S analysis is that the C sc of a photoelectrode can
be very complicated to measure depending on the sample composition and mor-
phology. The ideal sample is a single-crystal material of high crystalline quality
with moderate doping grown on an ohmic contact. Single-frequency measurements
of the C sc of an ideal sample are fairly straightforward. However, measurements
for samples which are not ideal may require a full evaluation of the frequency
range over many decades, followed by ﬁtting of the data to an appropriate, but
often complicated equivalent circuit model</p>

<p>The $E_\textrm{fb}$ can be determined by taking the value of the intercept between the extrapolated linear region of the $C^{−2}$ with the $x$-axis in the Mott-Schottky plot.</p>

<p> The barrier height ($\phi_b$) was calculated using the Schottky’s relation:
 \(\phi_b=E_\textrm{fb}+V_n\)</p>

<p>Where $V_n$ is the difference between the potential of the conduction band edge and the Fermi level, and was obtained by using the following relationship:</p>

\[V_n=kT\,\textrm{ln}(\frac{N_C}{N_D})\]

<p>The density of conduction band states ($N_C$) was calculated by</p>

\[N_C=2(\frac{2\pi m^*_ekT}{h^2})^{3/2}\]

<p>where $m^*_e$ is the effective mass of electron and  $h$ is the Planck’s constant.</p>

<p> The theoretical maximum photocurrent density under light illumination, $J_\textrm{max} (A\,m^{-2})$, is calculated by integrating the photon flux, shown in equation:</p>

\[J_\textrm{max}=e\times \int \limits_{\lambda_a}^{\lambda_b}\textrm{Flux}(\lambda)d\lambda\]

<p>where $\lambda_a$ is the shortest wavelength of the light emitted by the light source ($m$), $\lambda_b$ is the wavelength of the absorption edge of photoelectrode ($m$), $e$ is the charge of single electron ($1.602\times 10^{-19}\, C$), and $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the incident monochromatic light ($m$). Flux($\lambda$) is the photon flux of the light source ($m^{-2}\, s^{-1}\, nm^{-1}$), and it is calculated according to:</p>

\[\textrm{Flux}(\lambda)=P(\lambda)E(\lambda)\]

<p>where $P(\lambda)$ is the power of incident photons ($W\, m^{-2}\, nm^{-1}$). $E(\lambda)$ is the photon energy ($J$) and it is calculated from</p>

\[E(\lambda)=hc/\lambda\]

\[J_\textrm{max}=e\times \int \limits_{\lambda_a}^{\lambda_b}\frac{P(\lambda)\lambda}{hc}d\lambda\]

<!--more--></p>

\[J ^\textrm{H2O} _\textrm{photocurrent} = J _\textrm{absorbed} \times \eta _\textrm{charge separation} \times \eta _\textrm{charge injection}\]

<p>Where $\eta_\textrm{charge separation}$ is the yield of the photogenerated electrons/holes that reach the electrode/electrolyte interface or, in other words, the fraction of photogenerated electrons/holes that does not recombine with holes/electrons in the bulk of photoelectrodes. $\eta _\textrm{charge injection}$ is the yield of those electrons/holes that have reached the electrode/electrolyte interface and that are injected into the electrolyte to reduce/oxidize the water, or in other words, do not recombine with holes/electrons at surface traps. $J _\textrm{absorbed}$ is the current density converted from the absorbed photons when assuming that the absorbed photons are completely converted into electrons (APCE=100%), and it can be calculated by using the equation:</p>

\[J_\textrm{absorbed} = e\times\int\limits_{\lambda_a}^{\lambda_b}\frac{P(\lambda)}{\frac{hc}{\lambda}}A(\lambda)d\lambda = \frac{e}{hc}\times \int\limits_{\lambda_a}^{\lambda_b} P(\lambda)A(\lambda) \lambda d\lambda ​\]

<p>where $ \lambda_a$ is the shortest wavelength of the light emitted by the light source, $ \lambda_b$ is the wavelength of the absorption edge of the photoelectrode. $P$,$\lambda$, $h$, $c$, $e$, and $A$ are the power of incident photons, the wavelength of the incident monochromatic light, the Planck constant, the light speed, the charge of single electron, and the absorbance of the photoelectrode, respectively.</p>

<p> On the other hand, $\eta_\textrm{charge separation}$ is assumed to become 100% ($\eta_\textrm{charge injection} = 1$) in the presence of electron scavenger (usually ascorbic acid) or hole scavenger (usually H$_2$O$_2$ or Na$_2$SO$ _3$) in the electrolyte, then the photocurrent measured with scavenger in the electrolyte ($J^\textrm{scavenger} _\textrm{photocurrent}$) is a product of $J _\textrm{absorbed}$ and $\eta _\textrm{charge separation}$ only:</p>

\[J^\textrm{scavenger} _\textrm{photocurrent}=J _\textrm{absorbed}\times\eta _\textrm{charge separation}​\]

<p>So, the $\eta_\textrm{charge separation}$ and $\eta_\textrm{charge injection}$ can be calculated by</p>

\[\eta _\textrm{charge separation}= J^\textrm{scavenger} _\textrm{photocurrent} /J _\textrm{absorbed}\]

\[\eta _\textrm{charge injection}=J^\textrm{H2O} _\textrm{photocurrent}/J^\textrm{scavenger} _\textrm{photocurrent}\]

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>The scavenger used should be transparent to visible and UV light, does not corrode the photoelectrode, and importantly the injection barrier is removed and the surface recombination is suppressed. (No transient photocurrent in the chopped light J-t measurement)</li>
  <li>The band bending should remain the same in both electrolyte solution (with and without the scavenger), namely, the flat band potential should be the same from Mott-Schottky measurement.</li>
